# Reckless â€“ Chess Engine in Rust

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Guided by the insights from the chess programming community, it fearlessly
combines established concepts with its reckless nature, as the name suggests.

## Getting started

### Precompiled binaries

You can download precompiled builds from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/releases).

- `-avx512`: Fastest, requires a recent CPU with AVX-512 support.
- `-avx2`: Fast, supported on most modern CPUs.
- `-generic`: Compatible with virtually all CPUs, but significantly slower than AVX2 or AVX512 builds.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unsure which binary to use, try the AVX-512 build first. If it doesn't run on your system, fall back to the AVX2 build, or the generic one as a last resort.

### Building from source

To build Reckless from source, make sure you have:

- `Rust 1.79.0` or a later version installed ([official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
- `Clang` installed (required for building the [Fathom](https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom) library used for Syzygy endgame tablebase support)

Once installed, you can build it with:

```bash
cargo rustc --release -- -C target-cpu=native
# ./target/release/reckless
```

#### PGO builds

For profile-guided optimization (PGO) builds, you need to install additional tools:

```bash
rustup component add llvm-tools
cargo install cargo-pgo
```

Then, you can build the engine using `make`:

```bash
make
# ./reckless
```

Or run the steps manually:

```bash
cargo pgo instrument
cargo pgo run -- bench
cargo pgo optimize
# ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/reckless
# (the path may vary based on your system)
```

### Usage

Reckless is not a standalone chess program but a chess engine designed for use with UCI-compatible GUIs,
such as [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess), [En Croissant](https://encroissant.org),
or [Nibbler](https://github.com/rooklift/nibbler).

### Custom commands

Along with the standard UCI commands, Reckless supports additional commands for testing and debugging:

| Command         | Description                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `perft <depth>` | Run a [perft][perft] test to count the number of leaf nodes at a given depth       |
| `bench <depth>` | Run a [benchmark][bench] on a set of positions to measure the engine's performance |
| `eval`          | Print the static evaluation of the current position from white's perspective       |
| `compiler`      | Print the compiler version, target and flags used to compile the engine            |

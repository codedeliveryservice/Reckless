# Reckless â€“ Bitboard Chess Engine

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Reckless is a [UCI][uci] chess engine written in Rust as a personal project.

Guided by the insights from the chess programming community, it fearlessly
combines established concepts, as the name suggests.

## Getting started

### Precompiled binaries

You can download precompiled builds from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/releases).

### Building from source

To build the engine from source, make sure you have `Rust 1.65` or a later version installed.
If you don't have Rust, follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, compile the engine using `Cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Usage

Reckless is not a standalone chess program but a chess engine designed for use with UCI-compatible GUIs,
such as [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess) or [ChessBase](https://www.chessbase.com/).

Alternatively, you can communicate with the engine directly using the [UCI protocol](https://backscattering.de/chess/uci).

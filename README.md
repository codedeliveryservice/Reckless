# Reckless â€“ Chess Engine in Rust

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Guided by the insights from the chess programming community, it fearlessly
combines established concepts with its reckless nature, as the name suggests.

## Getting started

### Precompiled binaries

You can download precompiled builds from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/releases).

-   `x86_64-v1`: Slowest, compatible with any x86-64 CPU.
-   `x86_64-v2`: Faster, requires support for `POPCNT`, `SEE3`, etc.
-   `x86_64-v3`: Even faster, requires support for `AVX2`, etc.
-   `x86_64-v4`: Fastest, requires support for `AVX512`.

For detailed information on the specific features needed for each level, refer to the [x86-64 microarchitecture levels][microarchitecture] Wikipedia page.

[microarchitecture]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels

### Building from source

1. Make sure you have `Rust 1.79.0` or a later version installed. If not, follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Build the engine using one of the following methods:

```bash
# Cargo build (output: ./target/release/reckless)
cargo rustc --release -- -C target-cpu=native
```

### Usage

Reckless is not a standalone chess program but a chess engine designed for use with UCI-compatible GUIs,
such as [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess) or [ChessBase](https://www.chessbase.com/).

### Custom commands

Along with the standard UCI commands, Reckless supports additional commands for testing and debugging:

| Command         | Description                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `perft <depth>` | Run a [perft][perft] test to count the number of leaf nodes at a given depth       |
| `bench <depth>` | Run a [benchmark][bench] on a set of positions to measure the engine's performance |
| `eval`          | Print the static evaluation of the current position from white's perspective       |
| `compiler`      | Print the compiler version, target and flags used to compile the engine            |

[bench]: /src/tools/bench.rs

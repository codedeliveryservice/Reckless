# Reckless â€“ Bitboard Chess Engine

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

An attempt to create a simple yet playable [UCI][uci] chess engine.

Please note that the very idea of the project is mostly educational for exploring the Rust programming language.

## Board representation

-   Bitboards with Little-Endian Rank-File Mapping
-   Magic Bitboards for sliding pieces
-   Make/undo approach

## Move generation

-   Pseudo legal move generator
-   Pre-calculated attack maps with [Fancy Magic Bitboards][fancy-bitboards]
-   Magic numbers are pre-generated using [Reckless Magics][reckless-magics]
-   Compile time generation of move maps using a [build script](/game/src/lookup/build.rs)

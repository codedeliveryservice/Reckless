# Reckless â€“ Bitboard Chess Engine

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Reckless is a [UCI][uci] chess engine written in Rust as a personal project.

Guided by the insights from the chess programming community, it fearlessly
combines established concepts, as the name suggests.

### Move generation

-   Pseudo legal move generator
-   Pre-calculated attack maps using [Fancy Magic Bitboards](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards#Fancy)
-   Magic numbers are pre-generated using [Reckless Magics](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/RecklessMagics)
-   Compile time generation of move maps using a [build script](/src/lookup/build.rs)

### Search

-   Fail-Soft Alpha-Beta
-   Principle Variation Search
-   Quiescence Search
-   Iterative Deepening
-   Aspiration Windows
-   Lockless Transposition Table
-   Lazy SMP (Shared-Memory Parallel)

### Selectivity

#### Pruning

-   Reverse Futility Pruning
-   Null Move Pruning
-   Razoring
-   Futility Pruning
-   Late Move Pruning
-   Delta Pruning

#### Reductions

-   Fractional Late Move Reductions
-   Internal Iterative Reductions

#### Extensions

-   Check Extensions

### Move ordering

-   Hash Move
-   MVV-LVA
-   Killer Move Heuristic
-   History Heuristic
    -   Butterfly History
    -   Counter Move History
    -   Follow-Up History

### Evaluation

-   [NNUE](https://www.chessprogramming.org/NNUE)
-   Architecture: `(768 -> 128)x2 -> 1`
-   Activation Function: `SCReLU` (Squared Clipped Rectified Linear Unit)
-   Quantization: `i16` (`256`/`64`)
-   Trained on original data generated entirely through self-play
-   Handwritten SIMD for AVX2 instructions

## Getting started

### Precompiled binaries

You can download precompiled builds from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/releases).

-   `x86_64-v1`: Slowest, compatible with any x86-64 CPU.
-   `x86_64-v2`: Faster, requires support for `POPCNT`, `SEE3`, etc.
-   `x86_64-v3`: Even faster, requires support for `AVX2`, etc.
-   `x86_64-v4`: Fastest, requires support for `AVX512`.

For detailed information on the specific features needed for each level, refer to the [x86-64 microarchitecture levels][microarchitecture] Wikipedia page.

[microarchitecture]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels

### Building from source

To build the engine from source, make sure you have `Rust 1.65` or a later version installed.
If you don't have Rust, follow the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Then, compile the engine using `Cargo`:

```bash
cargo rustc --release -- -C target-cpu=native
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided `Makefile`:

```bash
# Build for the current CPU architecture
make
# Build release binaries for all microarchitecture levels
make release
```

### Usage

Reckless is not a standalone chess program but a chess engine designed for use with UCI-compatible GUIs,
such as [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess) or [ChessBase](https://www.chessbase.com/).

Alternatively, you can communicate with the engine directly using the [UCI protocol](https://backscattering.de/chess/uci).

### Custom commands

Along with the standard UCI commands, Reckless supports additional commands for testing and debugging:

| Command         | Description                                                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `perft <depth>` | Run a [perft][perft] test to count the number of leaf nodes at a given depth.       |
| `bench <depth>` | Run a [benchmark][bench] on a set of positions to measure the engine's performance. |
| `eval`          | Print the static evaluation of the current position from white's perspective.       |

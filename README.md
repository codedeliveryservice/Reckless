# Reckless â€“ Bitboard Chess Engine

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Reckless is a lightweight [UCI][uci] chess engine developed as a pet project to explore the Rust
programming language. While not designed to be a competitive engine, it provides a playable chess
engine with a reasonable strength. Please note that it is a learning experiment, and as such,
it may not follow the best practices or conventions typically found in high-quality engines.

## Getting started

### Precompiled binaries

You can download precompiled builds from the [GitHub Releases page][releases].

[releases]: https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless/releases

### Building from source

To build the engine from source, make sure you have `Rust 1.64` or a later version installed.
If you don't have Rust, follow the [official Rust installation guide][rust-guide].

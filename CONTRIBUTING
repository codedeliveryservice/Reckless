Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

This CLA applies to all contributions made to any repository within this organization. Furthermore, it encompasses all nets and data associated with the Montytest framework (under the domain name recklesschess.space) and any other outputs derived from that framework or domain. By contributing to this project, you agree to grant the Reckless Project, including its authorized representatives, the following rights:

1. The perpetual right to distribute your contributions under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) v3, as published by the Free Software Project. For further details refer to the LICENSE file. This right will always remain available for your contributions.
2. The perpetual right to re-license your contributions under other licenses, including but not limited to proprietary and commercial licenses, without any further notice to you. This includes the right to sublicense, modify, and commercialize the contributions as deemed appropriate by the Reckless Project or its authorized representatives. Any re-licensing will not negate the availability of your contributions under the AGPL v3.

By submitting your contributions, you agree to the terms of this CLA. You waive any claims of infringement or breach of rights against the Reckless Project for exercising the rights granted herein. You represent and warrant that you have the necessary permissions to grant the rights under this Agreement.

This CLA constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Reckless Project concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, representations, or understandings.

For the purposes of this Agreement, the members of the Reckless Project comprise the owners of this repository, specifically @codedeliveryservice. The term "authorized representative" shall mean any individual who has been duly granted authority by a member of the Reckless Project to act on their behalf for the purpose of granting permissions related to this Agreement. Such authority must be documented in writing and signed by a member of the Project. By definition, all members of the Reckless Project are also authorized representatives. Members of the Reckless Project must be notified in writing whenever any new authorized representative is appointed.

Any authorized representative that is not a member of the Reckless Project may be removed from their position by any member of the Reckless Project. Such removal must be documented in writing and signed by at least one member of the Project. In the event of a conflict where one member wishes to add or retain an authorized representative while another member wishes to remove them, the decision to remove the authorized representative shall take precedence and override the decision to add or retain them.

The addition of any new member to the Reckless Project must be agreed upon by all current members of the Reckless Project. If a current member does not respond to a request for adding a new member within 30 days from the date of the request, their consent shall be assumed, and the addition can proceed.

This software, including any modifications or derivative works thereof, is licensed under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL v3), as published by the Free Software Enterprise. Any use, distribution, or modification of this software must adhere to the terms and conditions of the AGPL v3, except where express written permission to deviate from such terms has been granted by an authorized representative of the Reckless Project.  Any such permission to deviate from the AGPL v3 must be obtained in the form of a written document, duly signed by at least one authorized representative of the Reckless Project. Members of the Reckless Project must be notified in writing whenever an authorized representative grants a license or any other permission related to this Agreement.

By contributing to, using, or modifying the Software, you agree to be bound by the terms of the AGPL v3, and acknowledge that any attempt to re-license, sublicense, or otherwise distribute the Software under terms other than those of the AGPL v3, without the express written consent of an authorized representative, is strictly prohibited and constitutes a violation of this Agreement.
